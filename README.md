# yeoman-generator-typescript

This is just a base example of a yeoman generator written in typescript
I originally tried to do this using yarn2 but had problems with yeoman supporting pnp
So this repo is setup for yarn v1 which just installs the modules into node_modules/

## Install depends

To install the depends
```
yarn install
```

To compile the typescript
```
yarn build
```

## Development - Running the generator

To run the generator on the disk during development

```
yo path\to\generator
```
